Health Consultation Disparities in Rural Nigerian Areas

## Problem Statement

Inadequate access to quality health consultations is a significant contributor to Nigeria's poor healthcare services, particularly in rural communities.

Delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and increased morbidity and mortality rates are consequences of limited access to quality health consultations. 

Misinformation and myths also spread in the absence of reliable health information. 

Additionally, preventive care suffers, exacerbating health disparities and economic burdens. 

Addressing this issue is crucial to improving Nigeria's healthcare sector.

Quality health consultations are essential for timely, accurate, and personalized healthcare delivery.
