## Problem

Health Consultation Disparities in Rural Nigerian Areas

## Problem Statement

Inadequate access to quality health consultations is a significant contributor to Nigeria's poor healthcare services, particularly in rural communities.

Delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and increased morbidity and mortality rates are consequences of limited access to quality health consultations. 

Misinformation and myths also spread in the absence of reliable health information. 

Additionally, preventive care suffers, exacerbating health disparities and economic burdens. 

Addressing this issue is crucial to improving Nigeria's healthcare sector.

Quality health consultations are essential for timely, accurate, and personalized healthcare delivery.

## Data Analysis

## Team's Solution Ideas

Through divergent thinking, we brainstormed indiviually and collectively. We came up a number of bad and good ideas. They includes;

- Set up small solar panel booths in rural areas to facilitate remote calls to doctors.
- Hospital  in the market
- Robotic Smart Consultant (Smart Doctor Sam).
- AI diagnostic app
- Train traditional healers to prescribe modern medications
- AI  diagnosis and prognosis app
- Solar-powered  Telehealth clinics/ stations
- Online platform for specialist consultations where rural healthcare professionals connect with urban-based specialist for consultations and advice
- Short Message Service (SMS)-based health information platform/ system


## Team's Final Idea

Through convergent thinking, we finalized on a possible solution. The solution idea is;
- Solar-powered Telehealth Stations:

### User Persona
User Persona: Nneoma Amadi
Overview
Nneoma is a 32-year-old community health worker living in a rural village in south-south Nigeria called Umuebule

Background and Context
Nneoma lives in the village with limited access to healthcare services. She's passionate about improving health outcomes in her community and has basic training in health education.

Demographics
- Age: 32
- Gender: Female
- Location: Rural village (Umuebule), south-south Nigeria
- Occupation: Community health worker
- Income: Very minimal, relying on occasional stipends from NGOs and farming.

Personal Story
Umuebule; Nneoma's village lacks a functional healthcare center, thus villagers visit herbal healers and those seeking proper healthcare are forced to travel to the city. Due to transportation issues most of them end up struggling with common illnesses and even die when the conditions severely deteriorate.Often times, she accompanies patients to the City, giving up her time and very little resources. Nneoma dreams of having a reliable healthcare solution that would improve her community's health and reduce her workload.

Pain Points and Challenges
1. Limited healthcare access: Nneoma's village lacks adequate healthcare services, leading to delayed treatment and poor health outcomes.
2. Transportation challenges: Traveling to distant healthcare facilities is time-consuming, expensive, and often unreliable.
3. Limited resources: Nneoma's community lacks access to trained healthcare professionals, medical equipment, and essential supplies.

By understanding Nneoma's challenges and context, the solar-powered telehealth stations/clinics solution can be tailored to meet the specific needs of rural communities like hers.
